# FlightDelay Insurance Smart Contract

## Project Description

FlightDelay Insurance is a decentralized smart contract solution built on the Stacks blockchain that provides automated compensation for flight delays and cancellations. The system allows passengers to purchase flight delay insurance by paying a premium, and automatically receive compensation tokens when their flights are delayed or cancelled, eliminating the traditional hassle of manual claim processes with airlines.

The smart contract integrates with real-time flight data (simulated through oracle updates) to determine flight status and automatically process compensation claims. Passengers can purchase insurance for specific flights, and the contract maintains an insurance pool funded by premiums to ensure sufficient liquidity for payouts.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the travel insurance industry by creating a transparent, automated, and trustless system for flight delay compensation. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Manual Claims Processing**: Remove the bureaucratic overhead and lengthy claim processes traditionally associated with flight delay compensation
- **Provide Instant Payouts**: Enable immediate compensation upon flight delay confirmation through smart contract automation
- **Create Transparent Insurance Pools**: Maintain publicly auditable insurance pools where all transactions and payouts are visible on the blockchain
- **Reduce Costs**: Lower operational costs by removing intermediaries and manual processing, passing savings to customers
- **Global Accessibility**: Provide flight delay insurance that works across all airlines and countries without geographical restrictions
